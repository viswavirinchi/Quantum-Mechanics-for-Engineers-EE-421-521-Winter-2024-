    "Quantum Mechanics has fundamentally changed the way we study natural phenomena on microscopic scales. However, we've only just started to realize how quantum mechanics can also revolutionize information processing and computer science. The new and promising field of quantum computing makes use of the powerful, albeit sometimes unintuitive, quantum phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical information processing begins with a bit, and analogously, quantum computing begins with a qubit. Information is measured in bits, where each bit will only ever be in one of two possible states (commonly referred to as \"0\" and \"1\"). A qubit is a two state quantum-system, so it's quite similar in that they only ever hold one bit of information, but the superposition principle in quantum mechanics allows a qubit to occupy any one of the continuum of states in Hilbert space - sounds like a contradiction, huh?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that even though a quantum system can occupy any state in Hilbert space, the only way we can get information from a qubit is by measuring it, at which point the state will collapse to one of the two possible basis states. For simplicity, let's choose a measurement operator which commutes with the Hamiltonian of our system, so we don't have to worry about the time dependence of our system. Now we can define the two eigenstates of our measurement operator to be $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ which forms our \"computational basis.\" (Look up what measurement in quantum mechanics means.)\n",

    "So in general, the state of our qubit $|\\psi \\rangle$ can be written as:\n",

The `StatevectorSampler` will run your quantum circuit without any noise, while Fake `Fake Sherbrooke`, like real quantum computers, will include noise in its computation. There are also some backends that will run your circuit on a real quantum computer (for more information check out IBMQ Experience).\n",
