# Quantum Mechanics for Engineers EE 421/521 (Winter 2024)

This course assumes prior familiarity with Python programming and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Recommended Setup
- Use **Anaconda** as your package manager for Python.
- Set up a **virtual environment** using Anaconda to avoid package conflicts.

## Turning Notebooks into PDFs
The best practice for exporting Jupyter Notebooks to PDFs is:
1. Export the notebook as **HTML** from Jupyter.
2. Open the HTML file in a browser.
3. Use the browser's print functionality to save it as a PDF.
